In order for the vertical bars of the barcode in the logo not to be blurred,
the logos must be rendered with a width that is a multiple of 178 pixels.

To add a new language, use the English logo, and replace the English tagline with a translated tagline.

For languages that use roman characters, please do not change the font.

Please do not move / resize the logo, and keep the SVG size at 178x150.

Using Inkscape, export PNG versions for sizes 178x150, 356x300, 712x600 and add them to the png directory.

Thank you!
