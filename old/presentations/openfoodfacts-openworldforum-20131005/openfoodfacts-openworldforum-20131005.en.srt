00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,419
When we talk about open data, we think about

3
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:15,529
public data...

4
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:18,560
But there are many other data
which are interesting in our

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,220
everyday lives and that companies produce.

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,929
There is one particularly interesting domain, it's

7
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,160
food, where it's not about public data
but data of

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,400
public interest.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,310
Today, I'll present you
Open Food Facts which is a

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,000
new way of opening

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,310
data owned by companies.

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:49,510
With the palm oil scandal,

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,460
the horsemeat scandal,we saw that
the food industry

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,450
is not always transparent

15
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,270


16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,230
This lack of transparency is
not good for anyone: This is not

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,780
good for the consumer who doesn't know what he eats

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,200
and has no options to choose from.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,970
This is not good for the environment: look at the palm oil case,

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,020
with the deforestation in 
Malaysia and Indonesia.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,830
Finally, this is not good for 
companies either, since

22
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,280
there it create a lack

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,520
of trust towards them.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,240
We said ourselves: if people can create the biggest

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,870
encyclopedy in the world,

26
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,340
if they can work together to create a map of the world which is

27
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,550
more detailed than the one Google made,

28
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,620
Why not try to create a database on

29
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,820
food products?

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,930
That's how, one year and a half ago, Open Food Facts started.

31
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,890
Open Food Facts is a database,

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,860
based on similar principle to Wikipedia

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,380
it's collaborative, people with a smartphone
like you and me:

34
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,230
we scan bar codes, we take
pictures of ingredients,

35
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,260
nutrition facts and every bits of information

36
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,810
then we put them all in a database

37
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,160
Today, there are almost 700 contributors

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,379
with over 12.000 products

39
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,579
everything is put into
an open database

40
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:18,249
under Open Database Licence.

41
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:20,989
A quick word on crowdsourcing:
it's working well

42
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:23,949
in fact in one year and a half,
we went over 10.000

43
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,669
products in France

44
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:28,629
It's working because it is
data of public interest

45
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:31,310
There is a lot of people today which are
careful about

46
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,899
what they eat

47
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:35,909
because they are alergic or intolerant to gluten

48
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,869
because they are careful about their health or cholesterol

49
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:43,489
or about palm oil...

50
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:46,849
What could be the use of a
database with information

51
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:47,779
on food?

52
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:51,179
The first and foremost:
is to decrypt the labels

53
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:56,329
like all these E330, E150d, etc... 

54
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,269
These are additives.

55
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,019
There is about 2.000 of them...

56
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,469
and most people know ... none.

57
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:07,159
What we can easily do,
it's to say E150d

58
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,199
it's the colorant which is in your
can of coke, it's caramel and

59
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,829
the complete name which is not on the label, is sulfite ammonia caramel

60
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,939
in California, is now on the list of

61
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,889
carcinogenic chemical substances

62
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:22,009
better to avoid it then...

63
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,639
Coca Cola removed the E150d from the US market.

64
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,679
but for us, in Europe, we still have this Coca Cola with

65
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:31,019
sulfite ammonia caramel

66
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,579
On the Fraise Tagada (Tagada strawberry) example

67
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:37,909
where there is not at all the word fraise (strawberry)
written on the packaging because

68
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:39,349
there isn't any in it.

69
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:42,919
However, there is cochineal, it's E120, it's a

70
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,389
red colorant.

71
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:48,059
and it's extract - I discovered this doing the project -

72
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:51,019
which is extracted from cochineal insect, some small insects which are farmed on

73
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,119
cactus in Mexico.

74
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:55,569
You squeeze your little insects, and then you have some cochineal juice

75
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,079
and it allows you to color your
candies but also the taramasalata

76
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,359
because taramasalata is made of cod eggs which are unfortunately gray...

77
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:05,309
so if we add a drop of
red colorant inside, some cochineal juice

78
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:07,599
it become pink, of course, it's much more pleasant

79
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,450
and we indeed realize,

80
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,620
looking in our database,
that we can look for all

81
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,199
of the products that contain

82
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,439
this carminic acid, this cochineal

83
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,590
and there plenty of things we
wouldn't suspect containg some

84
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,750


85
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,060
the saucissons, for them to be more red, we put some juice of

86
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,170
cochineal inside, the orange 
cheese crust

87
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,199
it's some yellow colorant with red colorant

88
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,970


89
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,069
Also something I like

90
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:37,029
and which is interesting on

91
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,870
labels, in UK,

92
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,210
is what we call the traffic light nutrition facts

93
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,440
it's showing you immediately with
red, orange and green labels

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,430
be careful, there is too much fat, there is too much
sugar, there is too much salt.

95
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:55,430
In 2011, there was a lot of ecologists and consumers groups which 
have tried to propose this to the European parliament

96
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,810
but there has been a huge lobby from
the food industry

97
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,370
who didn't want
to put a red flag

98
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,069
on a bag of chips.

99
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,520
So it has been rejected in 2011.

100
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,089
However, it's a thing that we can easily display

101
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:14,179
nicely this is a new app
that I am currently

102
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,089
developing

103
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,629
where we

104
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:21,270
put our mobile phone in front of

105
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,319
any product

106
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,189
and we can then see information like these

107
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,180
traffic light type of nutrition facts.

108
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,940
When you have a database of
products, it's also tempting, of course,

109
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,240
to compare between products, to compare my ketchup

110
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,680
to the average ketchups, it's written 30% less of sugar.

111
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,900
Is this true?

112
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,389
That the kind of things we can check:

113
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,009
Here, I show you a graphic

114
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:48,509
where I choose to display every sodas

115
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:51,830
with sugar on one axis and additives on the other.

116
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,439
you can go on the OpenFoodFacts.org website and within

117
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,119
with a few clicks, you can have the
same graphic with charcuterie and

118
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:05,180
the fat and the salt for example.

119
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,569
So, all of this

120
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:09,139
these data, these data on
what we're eating,

121
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,219
I think that this is data
so much important that they must be

122
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:14,229
public, they must be available,

123
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,860
so that's why we have, we have
we have created this

124
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,589
database.

125
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:22,739
There is a lot of startup that has been launched on this topic

126
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:23,930
of food,

127
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,460
and often, they wanted you
to scan the products and

128
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,889
that you send them some photos but after, they keep

129
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:34,060
the data for themselves, it's like their
war chest, it's what they

130
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,460
try to make business with

131
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,690
while, well, us, we are a non-profit
project

132
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,880
we have nothing to monetize and on the contrary, we
take full benefit of having these data

133
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,919
being useful

134
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,479
and used for as many applications as possible.

135
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,509
I'll show you some examples
of reuse:

136
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,529
this is a website called "C'est fabriqué près de chez vous"
(made near me)

137
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:58,309
it's done with these little codes which are
on food products that we

138
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:59,860
call packaging code

139
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,719
it's looks like

140
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:05,389
EMB 56081 E

141
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,389
so 56081 it's not a postal code but it's French INSEE code of the town

142
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,819
well we can now know that it's
produced in Theix in

143
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:13,849
Morbihan (Britanny, France).

144
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,139
We can now look somewhere on the French map where are

145
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,300
produced these products.

146
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,129
and then, what's fun, it's to look at all the other

147
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:23,210
products that are produced by the same
factory

148
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,849
well in our factory
in Theix, Morbihan

149
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:31,580
there is beans and carots, so on from the Daucy brand, it's the factory

150
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,209
of Daucy, but it's producing also
food for all the other brands

151
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,889
that are distributors.

152
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,680
This is a small pedagogical game
with data that we gather

153
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,050
The game goes like this: we show you a
product

154
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,110
and you try to find

155
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,120
their sugar equivalent in  
in number of sugar cubes

156
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,889
and sometimes you can be very stunned of
the quantity of sugar in

157
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,270
some food.

158
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,800
Soda, of course yes, we think
that it's sugary

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,909
however, fruit juices we may know a little less that it's

160
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:04,039
as sugary as the sodas and that
in my liter of banana juice

161
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:09,889
or pinapple juice, there is 45 sugar cubes

162
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:15,650
That's all, the presentation is done.
We have a wiki, everything is open,

163
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,740
the source code of the software is on Github

164
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,539


165
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,789


166
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:24,499


167
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:28,099


168
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:29,240


169
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,629


170
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:32,579


171
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:36,249


172
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,330


173
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,230


174
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:49,230


175
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:52,790


176
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,170


177
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,830


178
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,950
