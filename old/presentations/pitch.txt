I'm here to present the Open Food Facts project.
Basicaly we provide a free and open database.
Open Food Facts is wikipedia for food products.
It is a collaborative, crowdsourced effort to scan barcode, take picture, get nutrition data and list of ingredients.
We have over half a million products spanning 113 countries and territories, added by just over 8000 contributors.
That is 8000 people like you and me with access to a web browser and a fridge and/or a cupboard.
Use, contribution and re-use is free as in free beer and free as in freedom.
It means you can use the data, reproduce the data even for commercial use.
We only require attribution and share alike for sites and applications that use our data.
Few example of the potential for re-use are available.
One let's you play and try to guess how much sugar is in a given product.
Another one let me know what product are made near me.
My last exemple is a commercial app called "expiry date" that sends us the expiry date they collect from the app.
There are many other in the wild since there is no registration involved.
If you think that you could or contribute data, we would be delighted to have a chat about it.
So far we have about  6000 products sold in the UK only.
We are currently making a big push in the uk to collect a critical mass of product data.
Feel free to engage with us on twitter @openfoodfacts/@openfoodfactsuk, we love to get feedabck.
I'm giving away stickers, you can use that excuse to start and talk to us.
